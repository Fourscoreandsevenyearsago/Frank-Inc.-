    <h1 class="rules">Rules</h1>
    <h1 class="rulestext">Before we start ranking our animals, the rules need to be set clear. 
<br><br>
        The most obvious thing to discuss is weapons. Obviously, if I’m allowed a gun, no animal would really stand a chance. But that would basically be the weapon beating the animal, not me, so I obviously won’t be allowing that. For clarity’s sake, I’ll just be theorizing these as though I wouldn’t have any weapons.  
        Furthermore, aquatic animals must be discussed. It wouldn’t be fair if either of us were in the other’s habitat, so for those animals, half of the “arena” would be on land and half would be aquatic. 
        <br><br>
        I’ll also be allowed simple clothes, like a t-shirt and socks, but not any armour as that’s not what I would naturally wear. 
        <br><br>
        The victor will be the last creature standing, and what happens after won’t affect who wins.

            10. Goldfish
        </h1>
        <h2 class="goldfishtext">The innocent goldfish. Not as innocent as you might think. Goldfish are <br>major carriers of the Koi herpesvirus, a very contagious virus with an <br>even higher mortality rate. This typically is contracted with goldfish <br>living in poor aquarium conditions, which can be passed on. Also, <br>goldfish are rather tasty (allegedly) and if I eat one, it’s possible I may <br>contract a parasite, which probably would lower my chances of victory.
            <br><br>
            <br><br>- Goldfish have the ability to breathe underwater, aiding in their <br>evasion under the sea. This can allow them to tire me out by swimming <br>away whenever they spot me, eventually leading me to drown or <br>starve.  
            
            <br><br>- People typically get cocky when fighting goldfish, making <br>underestimation an issue.
            
            
            </h2>
            <h2 class="goldfishtext2">
                 
                - The goldfish is rather frail. A simple well timed punch should be able to finish it off.
                <br><br>- Becomes helpless out of water.
                <br><br>- Dies if it goes through too much stress.
                <br><br>- It’s a goldfish
                <br><br>Given the strengths and weaknesses, it would be best to play it safe. However, with the goldfish being so small and maneuverable in the water, it would make it a very difficult animal to catch. However, since goldfish can’t survive long periods of stress, I feel that I would succeed more often than not in this fight.

            9. Giant Snail</h1>
            <img src="giant-african-land-sna.jpeg" alt="snailimage" class="snailimage">
            <h1 class="snailtext">
                Snails are often considered some of the most pathetic and useless animals out there. But the African Giant Snail is no joke. 

<br><br>With a maximum size of over a foot and the biggest shell out of any snail, this specimen isn’t lacking when it comes to durability. In speed, however, the snail is extremely slow, giving me a massive advantage. Hitting the snail would be a different story, though, since they are poisonous and even touching them could be dangerous. 


<br><br><br><br>- Durability. The snail shell will give it decent protection against my attacks if it hides inside it, and its soft body will soak up attacks I throw at it. 
<br><br>- Passive damage. The snail is poisonous, so attacking it will also affect me. If I’m not able to take out the snail before the poison kicks in, I won’t be able to win the fight. 
<br><br>- Morality. Seriously, how can you kill something as helpless as a snail? Really?

            <h1 class="snailsnailsnail2">Weaknesses</h1>
            <h1 class="snailtext2">
                
                - Weakness to salt. Even a small amount of salt can kill a snail, and with <br>excessive crying I think I’d be able to make it shrivel up. 
                <br><br>- Speed. Snails are reeeealy slow. Considering the sequel to the bible will <br>probably be released in the time it takes this snail to blink, I think I’ll have <br>plenty of time to think during this fight, with the only obstacle being <br>dehydration. 
                
                <br><br><br>Even though the snail has more strengths than weaknesses, those two <br>weaknesses are extremely detrimental. If I got into a fight with a Giant <br>Snail, it wouldn’t really stand a chance as it wouldn’t be able to fight back. <br>Given its speed and reaction time, it probably would be put out of <br>commission before it even noticed it was being attacked. This fight <br>definitely wouldn’t feel good, but it would certainly end in a win.

                8. Two-toed Sloth</h1>
                <h1 class="slothtext">
                    The only surviving member of the infamous behemoth Megalonychidae, the two toed sloth shouldn’t be underestimated. Their claws are extremely sharp, and their bite can easily lead to infection: possibly even to losing a limb if left untreated. However, just like the Giant Snail, their speed greatly weighs them down. They have an extremely low metabolic rate, and can <br>only move so much in a day before they tire themselves out. 
<br><br><br><br>
- Claws. The sloth’s claws are extremely sharp, and they can easily cut you if you aren’t careful. 
<br><br>- Bite. The sloth bite isn’t just painful, but it holds lots of bacteria and can lead to infections very easily.

                <h1 class="slothtext2">
                    - Durability. Sloths are very frail. It’s not durable whatsoever. 
<br><br>- Strength. Sloths can’t move for long periods of time, and when they do <br>move or attack, they’re not all too strong. 
<br><br>- Speed. When people think of slow animals, they probably think of sloths. <br>Or snails. Regardless, there’s a good reason for it. 

<br><br><br>The speed and strength of the sloth holds it down too much, and it’s not <br>able to use its strong claws and teeth. If I wanted to, I could just keep <br>walking away from the sloth until it tires out. I think the only way that I lose <br>is if I get a heart attack mid-fight. This fight would probably feel WORSE <br>than the snail, somehow.

                        Being the most common type of raccoon, the spelled raccoon doesn’t <br>seem all too menacing. However, they have sharp claws and a nasty bite. <br>They’re also pretty fast, being the fastest animal on this list thus far by a <br>large amount. 
<br><br><br><br>
- Claws. The raccoon’s sharp claws could definitely deal some damage if <br>I’m not careful. 
<br><br>- Bite. Even if a raccoon’s bite strength isn’t anything to write home about, <br>getting bitten by any animal this big isn’t fun.

                    <h1 class="raccoontext2">- Overall strength. I’m stronger than a raccoon in pretty much every way aside from speed. 
                        <br><br>- Size. Since it’s so small, it can’t really do any damage to any part of my body aside from my legs. If it tries to jump at me, I’m fairly confident I can knock it back down. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        Since I’m stronger than a raccoon in every way, I think this fight would <br>rule overwhelmingly in my favour. There’s still a chance I lose this fight if I <br>make some really bad decisions, but I don’t think that’s all too likely. </h1>

                    <h1 class="spidertext">Being the biggest spider with a terrifying 30 centimetre leg span, the Goliath birdeater seems like it’d put up quite the fight. It’s equipped with a strong bite and irritating hairs that can cause extreme discomfort in humans. However, unlike many other spiders, the Goliath’s venom isn’t harmful to humans, giving me a better chance of making it on top in this fight. 
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        - Bite. The Goliath spider’s bite isn’t deadly to humans, but it still packs a punch. 
                       <br><br>- Irritating hairs. The Goliath spider can fling barbed hairs at attackers, causing serious irritation and even temporary blindness if it gets in the eyes.

                    <h1 class="monkeytext"> Being only 30 centimetres tall, the black-crowned Central American <br>squirrel monkey is a rather frail creature, but is probably one of the <br>more dangerous animals which I could beat on this list. The <br>Black-Crowned Central American Squirrel Monkey is found in the <br>western Pacific portion of Panama and the Osa Peninsula area of Costa <br>Rica, weighing around only 600 grams. They are also heavily affected by<br>a Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease epidemic at the moment, which, while it <br>can affect humans, shouldn’t be able to transmit fast enough for it to <br>affect me in the fight. 

                        <br><br><br><br>
                        - Small and agile, being able to easily outmaneuver me.

                        - Constant habitat threats mean only the strongest Black-Crowned <br>Central American Squirrel Monkeys will survive, showing that only the <br>most capable would still be around.

                            The Black-Crowned Central American Squirrel Monkey, with its small body would probably be beatable by me just because of its fragility and lack of ability to preform lethal damage.

                <h1 class="shrimptext">Though very small, the Mantis Shrimp possesses the strongest punch <br>out of any animal. With over 1500 newtons of force in a single punch, <br>the Mantis Shrimp shouldn’t be underestimated. Living in the the <br>Indian and Pacific oceans, these shrimp hunt worms, squid, and fish <br>using their strong strike. Their punch can break fingers and bruise <br>anywhere else, but this animal is greatly brought down by its size. 
                    <br><br><br><br>

                        <br><br>- Durability. One stomp would immediately get rid of the threat.

                        Though a possibility of disaster, I don’t think the Mantis Shrimp would have good odds of beating me. If I play it smart, I’ll fight it in a way that I wouldn’t be in danger of being hit by its strikes, for example by only attacking it from above. </h1>

                        <h1 class="baristext">At first glance, Baris would not seem like it would be a difficult fight. <br>At second glance, that would remain the same. 
                            When Baris was born, <br>he was, to say the least, special. He possessed a below average <br>amount of strength, even for a baby. However, from rigorous training, <br>he has improved since then, making him quite the opponent. 
                            <br><br><br><br>
                            - Turkish.

                            - Taller than me. I’m short, what can I say.

                            <h1 class="baristext2">- Bad eyesight. His eyesight is certainly less than 20/20. 
                                <br><br>
                                - Bad at pool. Would get smoked in any game of pool. <br><Br>
                                - Weakness to cold. Baris is notoriously sensitive to cold, so he might not be able to act as quick as he might be able to otherwise. 
                                <br><br><br>
                                This would definitely be a close fight, but I think that I would come out on top more times than not. Since he can’t see me very well, he might not be able to see me coming. He’ll also be slower than me due to the cold, so I feel like I’d have an advantage in this fight. It definitely wouldn’t be a guaranteed win, not even close, but I feel that because of my advantages I would be able to often win this fight.
